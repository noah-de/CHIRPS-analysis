# CHIRPS-analysis
Sample projects with CHIRPS data. http://chg.geog.ucsb.edu/data/chirps/index.html

1. Stack the Geotiffs from the same dekadal across the years within the dataset, and calculate the mean.
2. Subtracting the 2017 values (x<sub>t</sub>) from the historical mean (x̄) calculate the rainfall anomoly.
3. Color code to indicate unseasonable wet (blue) versus unseasonably dry (peach). Yellow is used to represent no change.
