1. Stack the Geotiffs from the same dekadal across the years within the dataset, and calculate the mean.
2. Subtracting the 2017 values (x<sub>t</sub>) from the historical mean (xÌ„) calculate the rainfall anomoly.
3. Color code: unseasonable wet (blue), unseasonably dry (peach), no change (yellow)
